            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>The history of electric can openers, like the one Shah’s Industry specializes in, is quite fascinating. The journey began in the early 1800s when Nicholas Appert invented canning, and Peter Durand improved upon it by using metal cans1. However, opening these cans was a challenge due to their thick metal construction. It wasn’t until the 1850s that cans started being produced with thinner steel, making it easier to open them.</p>
            <p>The first patent for a can opener was issued to Ezra Warren of Connecticut in 1858, which was widely used by soldiers during the Civil War1. The design evolved over the years, with the modern toothed-wheel crank design being invented by Charles Arthur Bunker in the 1920s1. This design is still the standard today. The first electric can opener was patented in 1931, revolutionizing the way we access canned goods</p>
            <p>Shah’s Industry, building upon this rich history, has continued to innovate and improve electric can openers, making them an indispensable part of modern kitchens. Their products reflect the evolution of technology and design, offering convenience and efficiency to users worldwide. While I don’t have specific historical details about Shah’s Industry itself, the electric can opener’s history is a testament to human ingenuity and the continuous pursuit of improving everyday life.</p>
